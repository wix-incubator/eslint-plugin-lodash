# Prefer [`_.flatMap`] over consecutive [`_.map`] and [`_.flatten`]

When using [`_.map`] and [`_.flatten`], it can be more concise to use [`_.flatMap`] instead.

## Rule Details

This rule takes no arguments.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
t = _.map(a, f);

t = _.flatten(_.map(a, f));
```

The following patterns are not considered warnings:

```js
_(a).map(f).flatten().value;

t = _.flatMap(a, f);
```


## When Not To Use It

If you do not want to enforce using [`_.flatMap`], and prefer [`_.map`] and [`_.flatten`] instead, you should not use this rule.
